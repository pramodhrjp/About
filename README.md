**About Me**

I am a passionate Python Developer with three years of experience building robust APIs, managing databases, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. My technical skill set spans Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, MSSQL, AWS, JavaScript, HTML, Docker, and Kubernetes, enabling me to deliver scalable and reliable solutions for diverse business needs.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise to become a Full Stack Developer, embracing new technologies and frameworks to create end-to-end web applications. I thrive in dynamic environments, enjoy tackling complex problems, and take pride in ensuring seamless client interactions.

Beyond coding, I love playing cricket and chess, which fuel my strategic thinking and teamwork skills. I am always eager to learn, improve, and contribute to innovative projects.
